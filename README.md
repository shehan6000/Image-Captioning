# Image-Captioning

## Overview
In this project , we will learn how to use the ðŸ¤— Transformers library for image captioning tasks. Specifically, we will use a pre-trained model to generate captions for a given image. This lesson will cover loading the necessary models and processors, processing images, and generating both conditional and unconditional captions.
